## raw discordance

### Making fractional discordance dataset
```{r}
metaFile = synGet("syn2299154")
metadata = read.csv(getFileLocation(metaFile), fileEncoding="macintosh")

genoIDs = metadata$DNA_genotyping_report..Genotyping.Sample_ID[match(colnames(discord_matrix), metadata$DLPFC_RNA_isolation..Sample.RNA.ID)]
accIDs = metadata$ACC_RNA_isolation..Sample.RNA.ID[match(colnames(discord_matrix), metadata$DLPFC_RNA_isolation..Sample.RNA.ID)]

# Only retain samples for which there is data in both ACC and PFC
filtered_discord = discord_matrix[match(toupper(accIDs), toupper(rownames(discord_matrix))),]
dim(filtered_discord)
filtered_sites = sites_matrix[match(toupper(accIDs), toupper(rownames(sites_matrix))),]
dim(filtered_sites)

fractional_discord = filtered_discord / filtered_sites
hist(fractional_discord, col = "honeydew", main = "fractional discordance")
hist(fractional_discord, col = "honeydew", xlim = range(0,0.3), breaks = 200, ylim = range(0,200), main = "discordance -- lower tail ")
```


### Self matches, ACC RNA to PFC RNA
```{r}
selfMatches = diag(fractional_discord)
names(selfMatches) = rownames(fractional_discord)
# How many are NA?
length(which(is.na(selfMatches)))


hist(selfMatches, col = "honeydew", xlab = "self discordance", breaks = 40)
# Investigating ones that don't match self
# Which RNA samples don't match self genotype
which(selfMatches > 0.17)

# Verify a few particular ones
# First, the two with high missingness in DNA
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_RNA_ACC_22")] # matches self
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_RNA_ACC_270")] # does not match self


# Three of the "mystery 4" for which there is PFC RNA -- didn't match self or non-self DNA or ACC RNA
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_RNA_ACC_25")] # doesn't match self
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_RNA_ACC_71")] # doesn't match self
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_RNA_ACC_87")] # doesn't match self

# Change the names to DNA ids
names(selfMatches) = genoIDs

# some of the "mystery 4" -- didn't match self or non-self DNA or ACC RNA
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_62")]
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_67")]
selfMatches[which(names(selfMatches) == "MSSM_231")]
```



### Non-self matches
```{r}
nonSelfMatches = fractional_discord - diag(x=selfMatches)
hist(nonSelfMatches, col = "honeydew", xlab = "fractional discordance", breaks = 50, ylim = range(0,40))
num_low_discord = apply(nonSelfMatches,MARGIN = 2,function(x){length(intersect(which(x < 0.2),which(x > 0)))})
which(num_low_discord == 1)
suspectCols = which(num_low_discord == 1)

for (i in 1:length(suspectCols)){
  print(colnames(nonSelfMatches)[suspectCols[i]])
  print(paste('non-self matches:', intersect(names(which(nonSelfMatches[,suspectCols[i]] < 0.2)), names(which(nonSelfMatches[,suspectCols[i]] > 0))), sep = ' '))  
}

# "MSSM_RNA_ACC_270" matches MSSM_RNA_PFC_228 instead of 224. PFC_228 should match ACC_217
# Other swaps / duplicates confirmed
